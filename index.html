      <p>
        Indigenize Toys began as a way to bring Indigenous languages and stories into kids’ daily lives – in homes, daycare rooms, language nests, and classrooms. The goal is simple: surround children with familiar words, songs, and teachings, using technology that fades into the background.

      <p>Coast Salish / Snuneymuxw consultant combining Indigenous cultural knowledge with expertise in health data and technology.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h3>Who I am</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Coast Salish man from Snuneymuxw First Nation, living and working on Coast Salish territories. My background is in health informatics and Indigenous governance, and my work focuses on making health systems, data, and community projects more accountable to Indigenous peoples — not just more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked within provincial health systems, Indigenous health teams, and community-based homelessness initiatives. Indigenize.Tech and Indigenize Toys bring those threads together: systems, data, and hands-on tools that families and communities can use.
      </p>
      <!-- Simplified phrasing and added context for consistency -->
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Values and approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Indigenous data sovereignty</strong> – Indigenous peoples decide how their data is collected, used, and governed (aligned with OCAP principles).</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships over transactions</strong> – the work is grounded in ongoing relationships, not one-off projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Honesty about systems</strong> – naming Indigenous-specific racism and structural issues directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Centering lived experience</strong> – pairing data with stories, context, and community knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical tools</strong> – outputs that people can actually use: reports, dashboards, trainings, and physical prototypes.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Added OCAP reference; clarified lived experience line; added 'prototypes' -->
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul class="alt">
        <li>Formal training in health informatics and Indigenous governance.</li>
        <li>Experience with Indigenous health teams on Indigenous-specific racism, cultural safety, and data governance.</li>
        <li>Lead roles in Point-in-Time homelessness counts with a strong Indigenous lens.</li>
        <li>Developed training and frameworks for analytics teams working with Indigenous data.</li>
        <li>Applied OCAP data principles in health analytics and governance projects.</li>
        <li>Indigenize Toys: early-stage platform for language and culture-focused toys and learning devices.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Added highlight on OCAP data principles -->
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Beyond the work</h3>
      <p>
        Outside of consulting and building tools, I spend a lot of time on the land and water – camping, hunting, fishing, and being active with my family. Those experiences shape how I think about territory, access, and the systems that surround us. The goal is always the same: support Indigenous people to live well, speak their languages, and have systems that are accountable to them.
