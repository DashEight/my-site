              <h2>About the Project</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Across Turtle Island and beyond, Indigenous languages are disappearingâ€”many without youth speakers. <strong>Indigenize Toys</strong> is a community-led, tech-powered initiative that hacks mass-market English-speaking toys and transforms them into tools for Indigenous language revitalization.</p>
            <p>Using microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP32, we repurpose plush toys and interactive devices to speak ancestral phrases and songs. Paired with workshops in soldering, coding, and audio recording, this playful approach empowers Indigenous youth and families to reclaim their languages from the inside out.</p>

              <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            </header>
            <ul>
              <li>43% of the worldâ€™s 6,000 languages are endangered</li>
              <li>Indigenous youth are still learning through Western toys that reinforce colonial worldviews</li>
              <li>Our solution blends tradition and technologyâ€”making language learning joyful, hands-on, and culturally resonant</li>
            </ul>

              <h2>Community Impact</h2>
            </header>
            <p>We work directly with Coast Salish communities like Snuneymuxw and Tsartlip, and partner with organizations like Kwâ€™umut Lelum. Our toys and workshops are co-designed, co-led, and co-created with community members. So far, weâ€™ve distributed over 50 toys and facilitated community-based builds.</p>

              <h2>Scalability Vision</h2>
            </header>
            <p>This work is designed to grow: from Coast Salish to Cree, from BC to Turtle Island-wide. Our modular approach allows us to adapt toys for any Indigenous languageâ€”fueled by open-source hardware, growing youth skills, and community partnerships.</p>
